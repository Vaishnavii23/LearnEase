      "\n",
      "Inflation is a situation in which the prices of goods, services go on rising substantially and at a fast pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods/services in an economy over a period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "An increase in the average price level of all products in an economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no unanimity among economist regarding the origin, causes and effects of inflation.\n",
      "Inflation: Definitions\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation as a \"state in which the value of money is falling, i.e., the prices are rising“. \n",
      "Crowther\n",
      "“Inflation is a persistent and considerable rise in the general level of prices.“\n",
      "Gardner Ackley\n",
      "Inflation is a situation of \"too much money chasing too few goods\". \n",
      "Coulborn\n",
      "1. Creeping Inflation\n",
      "Creeping or mild inflation is when prices rise 3 percent a year or less.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Federal Reserve, when prices increase 2 percent or less it benefits economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "This kind of mild inflation makes consumers expect that prices will keep going up. That boosts demand.\n",
      "2. Walking Inflation\n",
      "This type of inflation is between 3- 10 percent a year.\n",
      " It is harmful to the economy because it heats up economic growth too fast.\n",
      "People start to buy more than they need, just to avoid tomorrow's much higher prices.\n",
      "3. Galloping Inflation \n",
      "When inflation rises to 10 percent or more, it creates absolute damage on the economy.\n",
      "Money loses value so fast that business and employee income can't keep up with costs and prices.\n",
      "4. Hyperinflation\n",
      "Hyperinflation is when prices skyrocket more than 50 percent a month.\n",
      "It is very rare.\n",
      "In fact, most examples of hyperinflation have occurred only when governments printed money to pay for wars. \n",

      "1. Demand pull inflation\n",
      "Demand-pull inflation arises when the total demand for goods and services (i.e. 'aggregate demand') increases to exceed the supply of goods and services (i.e. 'aggregate supply') that can be sustainably produced.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why does aggregate demand rise?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Such as a rise in con­sumption demand or investment or government spending or a tax cut or a net increase in exports (i.e., C + I + G + X – M) with no increase in money sup­ply.\n",
      "2. Cost push inflation\n",
      "It occurs when there is fall in the level of supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is due to increase in the cost of production.\n",
